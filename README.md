## Introduction

JSON-CMS is a project that leverages JSON as the data layer for a content management system. This innovative approach eliminates the need for a Database Management System (DBMS). The goal is to provide a CMS capable of managing semi-dynamic websites that generate limited data, making the setup of a DBMS unnecessary. This approach also simplifies backups, as all data is conveniently stored in a single folder as files, making it easy to back up as needed.

Furthermore, JSON-CMS follows the standard usage of JSON, making it well-prepared for working with other client solutions. It can send JSON data as an API, enabling a wide range of possibilities for integrating content into various applications and platforms.
