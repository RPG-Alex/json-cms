# json-cms
<h2>A JSON file based CMS Project</h2>
<p>This project uses JSON as the data layer of for content management system, eliminating the need for a DBMS. The goal is to have a CMS that can manage semi dynamic websites that don't generate enough data to justify needing to setup a DBMS. It also simplifies backups as the data is all stored conveniently in one folder as files, and can be directly backed up, in whichever means is desired.</p>
<p>Additionally, the standard use of JSON means the CMS is well prepared for working with other client solutions, able to send the JSON data as an API etc.</p>
